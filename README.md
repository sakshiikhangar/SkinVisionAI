📸✨ SkinVisionAI
A smart system for detecting skin problems through image analysis and recommending personalized treatment solutions.

🩺 About the Project
SkinVisionAI is your pocket dermatologist — well, minus the expensive consultation fee. It detects various skin conditions such as:

Acne
Acne scars
dark circles
Pigmentation
open pores


It then prescribes suitable treatments using an intelligent recommendation system.

🎯 Key Features
✅ Upload skin images
✅ Automatic detection of common skin issues using a CNN
✅ Personalized treatment suggestions
✅ Handles multiple conditions using Market Basket Analysis (Apriori Algorithm)
✅ User profiles to track skin health over time (Coming Soon)
✅ Ingredient details
✅ Community feedback and continuous improvement

🔍 How It Works
Image Upload & Preprocessing:
Users upload a skin image — the system resizes and normalizes it for analysis.

Skin Problem Detection:
A trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) detects and classifies visible skin issues.

Treatment Recommendation:
A rule-based system (with a sprinkle of machine learning) recommends effective treatments and suitable ingredients.

Multiple Issues? No Problem!
Uses Market Basket Analysis to suggest a combo of treatments that play nicely together.
